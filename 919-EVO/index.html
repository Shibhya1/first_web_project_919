        <p><ul><li>“The entire hardware of the powertrain remains untouched,” says Porsche, but now it's binned the WEC-mandated fuel-flow meter that effectively limited the 919 to 500bhp, power from the 2.0-litre turbocharged V4 internal combustion engine has leapt up to 720hp. Power from the e-machine has increased from 400 to 440hp, giving <b>8.49 megajoules of boost</b>.</li>
        
          <Li>The front diffuser and rear wing are new, much bigger than the parts they replace and have “actively controlled drag-reduction” systems (a bit like DRS in an F1 car). These and other aerodynamic modifications means<b>53 per cent more downforce </b> than last year's car in Spa qualifying trim. This, Porsche claims, is more downforce than an F1 car.</Li> 
        
       
           <li> Porsche also added a four-wheel brake-by-wire system, different power steering and stronger suspension wishbones. Removal of the air conditioning, windscreen wiper, several sensors and the pneumatic jacks mean weight is down by 39kg to just 849kg.</li>
